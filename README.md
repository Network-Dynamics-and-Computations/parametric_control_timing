These are the codes for the reserach article:
Beiran*, M., Meirhaeghe*, N., Sohn, H., Jazayeri, M., & Ostojic, S. (2023). Parametric control of flexible timing through low-dimensional neural manifolds. Neuron, 111(5), 739-753

The main figures of the publication showing results can be reproduced by running the corresponding script. They take between a few seconds and a few minutes (up to 3min) to run. To do so, we are including also the data files for several trained RNN. We are also including sample code for training the RNNs on the different tasks (to do).
